• What does fast-forward in Git mean?

     Fast_Forward in Git is nothing but reaching the target branch from source branch by just moving the pointer forward without doing any extra commits.
   Lets suppose there is a master branch and we created a new feature branch from master branch. Now both are at same commit c1. Suppose we made changes 
   to feature branch and we have done commit c2. If we want to move master branch to latest changes git will use fast forward approach and move simply
   the pointer forward to c2 from c1.
   
• Why should you have different branches?

     In a project there will be a lot of features to develop and along with that multiple developers will be working on the same code. In order to provide
  this feasibility branching helps to isolate each developer work from others team members. It helps to maintain and manage different versions of code.With
  the help of creating branches developes can work on differnt bugs or new features simultaneously.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

      In general we can have as many remote git repositories for a single project. These remote repositories will define the versions of the project. Having
  multiple repos help the team to work and maintain code of production, QA or Dev parallely.
